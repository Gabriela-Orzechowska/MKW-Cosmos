# MKW-Cosmos
I need to update this 

Mario Kart Wii code extension for CT distributions.

## Building
Run `Build.bat`. Update `CC=` path inside `Build.bat` if needed.

### Requires
[CodeWarrior for MPC55xx/MPC56xx v2.10 Special Edition](https://nxp.com/lgfiles/devsuites/PowerPC/CW55xx_v2_10_SE.exe) ([mirror](https://cache.nxp.com/lgfiles/devsuites/PowerPC/CW55xx_v2_10_SE.exe))

## Current Features
### General
- Slot Expansion (indev)
- Discord Rich Presence
- Files loading from additional archives/bmg files
- Auto BRSAR Patching
- Full ghost support (saving, watching, racing)
- Various debugging features
- SD Card Support
- Custom Track Selection
- Performance Monitor

### Gameplay
- Time Trial CC mode selection
- No multi channel music cut off
- Many minor fixes and patches
- Speed-o-meter
